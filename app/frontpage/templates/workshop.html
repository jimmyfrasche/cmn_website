                <h2>Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing in Neuroscience: Embracing web technology for more open and collaborative science</h2>

						<p>Despite rapid advances in automation and machine learning there remain many tasks in biomedical science that require intensive manual work from domain experts. New web technologies have made it possible to distribute these tasks across large numbers of volunteers throughout the world. Early successes with protein folding have spurred additional projects in neuron labelling and tracing. More recently the brain imaging community has begun to explore crowdsourcing for anatomical segmentation and labelling. Dr. Kesavan will discuss her recent work building these tools as well as a new collaborative project with the NIMH Data Science and Sharing Team. For more information on Dr. Keshavan's work see:</p>

                <h2>How not to fool yourself with p-values and other statistics</h2>

						<p>In 2016 the American Statistical Association published its first position paper on the use of p-values, and recently this year a group of statisticians and other researchers published a paper recommending a change to the traditional definition of statistical significance. This talk will discuss some of the p-values problems and solutions raised in these and other papers, illustrating the ideas through a series of examples of published studies. The need for more attention to the communication and "human factors" of statistics and data science will also be briefly discussed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Regina Nuzzo received her Ph.D. in statistics from Stanford University, post-doctoral training in the Music Cognition Lab at McGill University, and graduate science writing training at University of California, Santa Cruz. She is a professor at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, and her writings about data, probability, and statistics have been published in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/nuzzo-fooling" rel=noopener target="_blank">Nature</a>,  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/jm77hyz" rel=noopener target="_blank">New Scientist</a>, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/zcuwbso" rel=noopener target="_blank">Scientific American</a>, and the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/z9vgok5" rel=noopener target="_blank">New York Times</a>, among others. Her Nature feature article about the P-value won the American Statistical Associationâ€™s 2014 Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award, and in 2015 she facilitated the ASA working group conference that produced the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/asapvalues" rel=noopener target="_blank">p-values consensus statement</a>.</p>
